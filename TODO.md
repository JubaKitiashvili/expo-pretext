## Deferred (wait for user feedback before implementing)

These were originally in Tier 5 but deferred — the current implementation is
good enough for typical use cases, and real-world impact is unproven.

- [ ] **Hermes Intl.Segmenter C++ fallback** — only affects ZWJ emoji edge cases; current spread-operator fallback works for 99% of cases. Reconsider if users report emoji rendering issues.
- [ ] **iPad split-screen / foldable optimization** — `layout()` is already 0.0002ms; batch re-layout on Dimensions change is a convenience hook, not a performance necessity. Reconsider if users report slow width transitions.

## Follow-up work (post-v0.8.x)

### Demo app enhancements

- [x] Typewriter demo using `useTypewriterLayout`
- [x] Text morphing demo ("Thinking..." → response transition)
- [x] Pinch-to-zoom demo using `usePinchToZoomText`
- [x] Breakout Text arcade game (flagship `layoutColumn()` demo)
- [x] Text Path with per-character tangent rotation
- [x] Umbrella Reflow (Matrix rain + shadow blocking)
- [ ] Accessibility demo with `onFontScaleChange`
- [ ] Debug overlay demo showing predicted vs actual
- [ ] Snapshot testing example in CI

### Documentation

## Principles (not tasks)

- Accuracy demo = primary canary. Every release: PASS on all test widths.
- CJK most sensitive, Arabic/Georgian/Thai secondary canaries.
- AI chat demo = primary dogfood. Editorial demos = rich line API dogfood.
- Native measurement = ground truth. JS fallback = safety net.
- Keep layout() allocation-light. prepare() is the bottleneck.
- Never blindly port upstream web fixes — our native backends differ fundamentally.
- Each task: analyze code → implement → audit → test → verify → commit → next.
- Every version: git push + npm publish. Never leave local-only.
- Every task: full test suite + integration tests. Never unit tests alone.

## Not worth doing

- Full markdown renderer in core (extract to companion package instead)
- Measurement in layout()
- Font loading/management (expo-font's job)
- Text rendering (RN Text's job)
- Cache tuning knobs in public API
- Pixel-perfect accuracy as product claim
- onLayout fallback reconciliation
- Camera/AR/ML integration (application-layer, not library concern)

## Open design questions

- Whether prepareStreaming should carry forward line-break state
- Whether whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' should handle configurable tab stops
- Whether obstacle layout should support arbitrary shapes (upstream #99)
- Whether measureNaturalWidth should extend to rich inline flow
- Whether a validateFont utility should be exported
- Whether a diagnostic verify mode (JS vs native comparison) is worth having
- Whether typewriter and morphing hooks need a shared animation primitive
